## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: N8N removal scheduled last (Phase 5) -- keep as fallback during connector implementation
- [Roadmap]: Undocumented ERPs (TopSApp, RadiusNet, Gere, ReceitaNet) isolated in Phase 6 -- may be deferred to v2 if APIs prove inaccessible
- [Roadmap]: Backend modularization before ERP connectors -- 4350-line routes.ts cannot safely absorb new integrations

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Phase 6]: 4 ERPs have no public API documentation -- research may conclude they are not integrable
- [Phase 7]: Legal opinion on platform classification under Lei 12.414/2011 should be commissioned during earlier phases
- [Phase 4]: IXC IP whitelisting may require provider coordination after Docker migration
